# HOW TO SET UP YOUR NETWORKS

# Each VM can attach to one or more of the networks below—just keep the NIC
# numbers consistent (e.g., NIC 1 is always Host-Only, NIC 2 is NAT, etc.)
# Note: To control the VMs with Ansible, every VM must include a Host-Only adapter

# NIC 1 - vboxnet0 (or name of yout own Host-Only network), type: hostonly
#   - By default the Host-Only  network  does not exist
#   - Create it via: VirtualBox -> Tools -> Network -> Host-Only Networks -> Create -> Enable the DHCP server
#   - depending on your system you will have a different name, in the example the hostonly natwerk is named vboxnet0, you need to replace this name with the name of your own network

# NIC 2 - NAT
#   - VirtualBox ≤ 7.0.24: simply indicate "type: nat" for the adapter; no additional setup is needed
#   - VirtualBox > 7.0.24: first create a NAT Network. Open VirtualBox -> Tools -> Network -> NAT Networks -> Create -> enable the DHCP server 
#     This lets the VM reach the Internet even when the NAT adapter is not the first one

# NIC 3 - subnet_a, type: intnet (Internal Network)
# NIC 4 - subnet_b, type: intnet (Internal Network)
# NIC 5 - subnet_dmz, type: intnet (Internal Network)
